# AutoColourCalibrator
Automatically (somewhat) OBS LUT generation from a picture containing a standard 24 element test card

Should be relatively-intuative. Simply open an image containig a 24 element test card, double click to select the corners of the card (starting at the white square and going anti-clockwise) and then hit Do Calibrate!

You can then tweak the brightness/shadows etc (NB: this does move away from the colour calibrated state, but may be required to make your picture look as desired), then hit save LUT!
